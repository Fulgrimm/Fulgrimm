> *A narrative-driven RPG built alongside Clinic Gemini — channeling resilience, memory, and the mythic echoes of a forgotten world.*

In *What They Didn't Tell*, players awaken in a surreal city caught between reality and legend. This world reacts to your decisions, reshaping its lore through ancient archives, emotional memories, and dynamic storytelling. The game features:

- 🧠 AI-enhanced NPCs with adaptive responses  
- 📜 Branching storylines woven through modular design  
- 🌙 Atmospheric gameplay inspired by Latin American folklore  
- 💾 Emotional memory tracking with persistent consequences  

🛠️ Built with scalability in mind — just like Gemini — but crafted to explore identity and healing through interactive storytelling.
